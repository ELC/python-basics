# Autograding Python Basics

This repository was created with the [Autograding Python Assignments
Template](https://github.com/ELC/python-assignment-template)

Each exercise in this assignment is designed to be autogradable outside of the
Github Classroom system by simply running:

`python exercise/<exercise>.py`

For each exercise, the signature and a docstring is given, the tests inside the
`tests` folder are for the Github Classroom Grading mechanism.

**Important Note**: Understanding all the concepts in these exersises is
required to move to more advance topics such as Object Oriented Programming.
